# A structure type needs a list of fields and some way of describing how they
# relate to each other for pointer purposes.

# A structure instance gets an attribute for each field in the structure type.

# There must be some way for modules to create their own structure types for
# purposes like loading extra data after the main struct. Field descriptions
# need some way of indicating whether they should be loaded or not

# Perhaps a meta field indicating data, pointer, optional? No, pointer is
# already implied by the pointer field, so I need default-vs-optional.

# Possibility: structure type contains a list of fields to treat as
# baseload/postload/dereference, defaults to all except
# pointers/nothing/pointers

# No, should be explicit in map. Just not sure which field it belongs in.
